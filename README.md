### Katas
#####Programming exercises to practice and improve regularly

From"**Clean Code**" by Robert C. Martin, a programming kata is a way to practice and hone skills as a programmer. You repeat the solution of the same problem, refactoring and optimizing with each iteration.

Very Agile, don't you think?

Git strikes me as the perfect vehicle to track this incremental progress, so here we are.

* Practice solving common coding problems
* Refactor as a habit so it's not intimidating
* Find use cases for both new and familiar algorithms
* Have fun and relax by working through coding puzzles
